<body>
    <h1 id="working-group-on-differential-cohesive-topos">Working Group on Differential Cohesive Topos</h1>
    <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
    <p>The main goal of this seminar is to understand Urs Schreiber’s work <a
            href="https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos">Differential
            cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos</a> and other related material.</p>
    <h2 id="format">Format</h2>
    <p>This seminar is inspired <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rdobben/exodromy.html">Exodromy</a>. We aim for
        informal talks, and we can take as much time as we need. This group can last for an extended period so that we
        can have time to work on more content.</p>
    <p>Talks will be on sometime each week (TBA) through Zoom. Everyone who wants to participate can fill <a
            href="https://forms.gle/N7Bixe3drvAt7zfS7">the form</a> (or see <a href="#registration">below</a>) and join
        our <a href="https://discord.gg/nUkSJJQgee">Discord</a>. You can also contact me by <a
            href="mailto:keyao.peng@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr">by mail</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="about-the-prerequisites">About the Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Because we can plan for this group to continue for some time, we can work and discuss some advanced and not so
        well-known prerequisites, like higher topos theory. My point is that we do not need to be experts for using them
        in [DCCIT]. Instead, we can first try to have rough pictures, know what they are, and keep some examples in
        mind. Then we can use them to read further texts, like here [DCCIT]; in that process, we can gradually realize
        the details we missed. That is also the goal of this seminar. We also list some helpful resources below for you.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there are some things that we assume to be known, like the basics of category theory, differential
        geometry and algebraic topology. But if you don't have confidence in those, don't worry, since it is often
        enough to just know the basic idea in many cases, and we will later give them new interpretations at a higher
        level as we progress. On the other hand, since these prerequisites are well-known and classical, there is a lot
        of material, and it is not too hard to brush up on the basics, so it should be possible to quickly catch up.</p>
