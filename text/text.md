# Working Group on Differential Cohesive Topos

## Outline

The main goal of this seminar is to understand Urs Schreiber’s work [Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos) and other related material.

## Format

This seminar is inspired [Exodromy](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rdobben/exodromy.html). We aim for informal talks, and we can take as much time as we need. This group can last for an extended period so that we can have time to work on more content.

We run our group more asynchronous and flexible: the speakers can choose the lecture time as they want or record a video by themselves, and then we put the record online. Everyone who wants to participate can fill [the form](https://forms.gle/N7Bixe3drvAt7zfS7) (or see [below](#registration)) and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nUkSJJQgee). You can also subscribe our [mail list](https://listes.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/sympa/subscribe/dif-coh-topos) or contact me by [by mail](mailto:keyao.peng@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).

## About the Prerequisites

Because we can plan for this group to continue for some time, we can work and discuss some advanced and not so well-known prerequisites, like higher topos theory. My point is that we do not need to be experts for using them in [DCCIT]. Instead, we can first try to have rough pictures, know what they are, and keep some examples in mind. Then we can use them to read further texts, like here [DCCIT]; in that process, we can gradually realize the details we missed. That is also the goal of this seminar. We also list some helpful resources below for you.

Of course, there are some things that we assume to be known, like the basics of category theory, differential geometry and algebraic topology. But if you don't have confidence in those, don't worry, since it is often enough to just know the basic idea in many cases, and we will later give them new interpretations at a higher level as we progress. On the other hand, since these prerequisites are well-known and classical, there is a lot of material, and it is not too hard to brush up on the basics, so it should be possible to quickly catch up.
